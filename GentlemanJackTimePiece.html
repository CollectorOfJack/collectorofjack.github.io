					<p>
						One of the things I want to do here on this blog is document the
						various Jack Daniel’s collectables, primarily bottles, that I’ve
						managed to acquire over time. This is the first post in that series.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2017, Jack Daniel’s announced/released a new bottle in the
						Gentleman Jack product line, called The Limited Edition Gentleman
						Jack, often referred to as the Time Piece. The bottle markings on
						the packaging of the bottle are reminiscent of the pocket watch that
						Jack Daniel carried around.
					</p>
					<p>
						I had trouble trying to locate the bottle here in St. Louis,
						checking all the local liquor stores, along with the big box Total
						Wine locations. In March of 2018 I was driving to Georgia for an
						autocross event with a buddy of mine, and stopped to buy a car in
						Murfreesboro Tennessee. While at the dealer, I asked my sales guy
						where I could find a decent liquor store, so that I could try to
						find the Time Piece. He sent me a few streets over, and I found a
						bottle of Tennessee Rye which I hadn’t seen before, but no Time
						Piece to be found. It was getting late in the day, and I was hoping
						to try to swing by the Distillery (my buddy who drove me to
						Murfreesboro had headed down there while I was doing paperwork on
						the car), but I wasn’t sure if I could make it down before the White
						Rabbit bottle shop closed.
					</p>
					<p>
						I decided I would try another liquor store on the way over to
						Lynchburg. At this store I asked the guys behind the counter if they
						had a Time Piece bottle. One guy said yes he did, but it was in his
						private collection, and not for sale. I looked around the store,
						picked up something there (can’t recall which bottle) and then
						checked out. While checking out he mentioned that there was a place
						near Shelbyville, called Celebration Liquors that might have the
						bottle. It was on my way to Lynchburg, so I decided I was for sure
						stopping when I got there. Upon arrival I looked around the store,
						but couldn’t find the bottle. I asked the girl behind the counter if
						she knew anything about the bottle, but she didn’t know what it was.
						If I recall correctly, she did however offer to call the owner, and
						he told her the bottle was right behind her.
					</p>
					<p>
						We both had missed it sitting there on a shelf behind the counter.
						Score! I was able to purchase one bottle of the Gentleman Jack
						Limited Edition bottle, seen above on this post. What this hunt made
						me realize though, was that I wasn’t the only one out there
						collecting Jack Daniel’s gear. I realized that people collected, and
						even collected extras, so that they could “trade” for other items to
						add to their collections.
					</p>
					<p>
						A few short weeks ago, I stopped by Total Wine on my way home from
						work one day, something I occasionally do just to see if they have
						anything JD related in stock that I don’t have. This time, they did,
						they had Time Piece bottles, and multiple! I picked one up, and
						walked to the register, paying about 50% of what I paid for the
						bottle in Shelbyville. By the time I got home I started kicking
						myself for not buying a few, when I stopped by that Total Wine again
						they were completely out. I ended up checking another TW location
						the next weekend and picked up 3 more bottles so that I could start
						creating a stock of items that I could trade in the future!
					</p>
					<p>

						bottle, check out my
						<a href="http://collectorofjack.com/WantedItems">Hunt List</a> to
						see if you have something I need, maybe we can trade!
