description: The 2020 Release of the Limited Edition Jack Daniel's Eric Church Single Barrel Select
---

In July/August 2020 Jack Daniel's released the 2020 version of the Eric Church Single Barrel Select bottle, a follow on release after their 2019 Eric Church Double Down Tour. The bottle is a beautiful opaque black with a black and gold label. It came with a paper hang tag, also in black and gold.

#### The front of the label, and the front of the hang tag state:
> Special Edition Jack Daniel's Eric Church Single Barrel Select Tennessee Whiskey

#### The rear of the hang tag reads:
> Music and friendships were always important to Mr. Jack. That's why we are proud to offer this special edition Jack Daniel's single barrel package celebrating our longstanding friendship with Eric Church who shares Jack Daniel's spirit of Community. In 2013 Eric and his wife, Katherine, created the non-profit "Chief Cares Fund" to impact lives around the globe and in our own neighborhoods.

#### The rear of the label reads:
> This special edition Jack Daniel's single barrel package celebrates our friendship with Eric Church. Master Distiller, Jeff Arnett hand-selected this 94 proof single barrel Tennessee Whiskey according to Eric Church's favorite Jack Daniel's taste profile.

In the photos below you might notice a metal hang tag as well. That tag was created by the Sunshine State Squires group on Facebook and available for purchase through them, though I don't believe it is still available.

The Eric Church Single Barrel release was a hard find in 2020, selling very quickly where available. I was able to track down a bottle in Texas which I ordered and had a family member pick up. I also was able to locate a bottle via an online order from Florida, and shortly after receiving that order it showed up in St. Louis and I was able to track down a bottle or two here as well.

There are a variety of dates of bottling for the 2020 edition of the Eric Church release, with some dates in June 2020 and July 2020. I have bottles with both 6/26/2020 and 7/23/2020 bottling dates.

You can still find the bottle online, though not at many locations that will ship out of their home states. Bottle price as of August 2020 varies from $60 up to $250.
