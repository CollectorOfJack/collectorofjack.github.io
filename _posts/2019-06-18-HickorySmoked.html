<div class="image-wrap"><img src="/images/4/HickorySmoked-1.jpg" alt="{{page.title}}"></div><p>In my previous blog post I talked about the Tennessee Tasters’ High Angel’s Share Barrels, in this post I cover the second release in the series, Hickory Smoked. The bottle is labelled as "Tennessee Whiskey Finish with Charred Hickory Staves". </p><blockquote><p><strong>Smoked Hickory Finish</strong> – a fully matured whiskey finished with charred hickory staves for a smoky flavor at 100-proof, just in time for the 30<sup>th</sup> annual Jack Daniel’s World Championship Invitational BBQ which is held in Lynchburg on Oct. 27. Selected by Master Taster Marsha Hale and available late-October.</p><p align="left">- <a href="http://pressroom.jackdaniels.com/jack-daniels-launches-limited-edition-tennessee-tasters-selection/" target="_blank">Jack Daniel’s Press Release</a></p></blockquote><p>This selection was from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marsha-hale-82543b37/" target="_blank">master taster Marsha Hale</a>, whom according to her Linked In profile has worked at Jack Daniel’s for almost 31 years. </p><p>I have yet to decide if I will try these bottles myself. I do have two of each, with the original intention of keeping one and having the other for trading to fill my collection with missing items. If however I could come across some other bottles, I would likely try one out myself, only time will tell if that happens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Release</strong>: October 2018<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 100<br><strong>Size</strong>: 375ml</p><div class="gallery" data-columns="3"><img src="/images/4/HickorySmoked-1.jpg"><img src="/images/4/HickorySmoked-2.jpg"><img src="/images/4/HickorySmoked-3.jpg"><img src="/images/4/HickorySmoked-4.jpg"><img src="/images/4/HickorySmoked-5.jpg"></div>
