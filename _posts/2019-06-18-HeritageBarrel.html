<div class="image-wrap"><img src="/images/5/HeritageBarrel-1.jpg" alt="{{page.title}}"></div><p>In late September 2018 Jack Daniel’s announced a new Special Release Tennessee Whiskey, Single Barrel Heritage Barrel.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>This release celebrates the early craftsmanship of the Jack Daniel Distillery. The whiskey is from uniquely crafted heavy-toast barrels and 100 proof barrel entry proof. <p>The "Heritage Barrel" expression of Jack Daniel's Single Barrel was crafted with a low temperature, heavy toasted barrel which created a light but rich char full of deep flavor. A lower 100 proof entry proof allows our grain bill to assert itself creating a special Tennessee whiskey with notes of light baking spices, vanilla, and toasted oak with a long, lingering finish, aged to perfection at the top of one of the highest elevated barrelhouses, 1-09, on Coy Hill. What emerges is a flavorful and rich Tennessee Whiskey. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p align="right"><a href="https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us/whiskey/limited/single-barrel-heritage-barrel" target="_blank">JackDaniels.com</a></p></blockquote><p>The included cardboard wrapped on the neck of the bottle, reads:</p><blockquote><p>Master Distiller Jeff Arnett and his team of whiskey makers created a truly unique whiskey for this special release of Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel.</p><p>The “Heritage Barrel” expression of Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel was crafted with a low temperature, heavy toasted barrel which creates a light but rich char full of deep flavor.

Lucas Liquors tells me (<a href="https://twitter.com/christoc/status/1063843217655951360" target="_blank">via twitter</a>) that they might be available here before Christmas. The gentleman at 141 Liquors tells me that his distributor says they won’t see any before May. Based on this info so far, I doubt they’ll make it to Missouri at all considering the release is limited to 200 total barrels. </p><p>I was fortunate enough to only stumble upon it online after doing some searching one weekend. I found it on a website called SipWhiskey.com, and while their communication/customer service left some things to be desired, and their packing of the bottle made me seriously question if it would still be intact when I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised that I received bottle in perfect shape. Unfortunately their website says they are out of stock now, but perhaps they will get it back in stock again soon. </p><p>Good luck hunting!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Release</strong>: Fall 2018<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 100<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml</p><div class="gallery" data-columns="3"><img src="/images/5/HeritageBarrel-1.jpg"><img src="/images/5/HeritageBarrel-2.jpg"><img src="/images/5/HeritageBarrel-3.jpg"><img src="/images/5/HeritageBarrel-4.jpg"><img src="/images/5/HeritageBarrel-5.jpg"></div>
