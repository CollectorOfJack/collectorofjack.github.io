description: My trip to Jack Daniel's Distillery in June 2021
---

This week I got out on my first work trip, since probably August 2019. I started a new job last year, about a week after the world shut down for the pandemic, so work trips have been on hold for quite some time, that and the last employer stopped my travelling, so I hadn't been on the road for work in quite some time. It was great to get out and meet some fellow employees and customers face to face.

Fortunately for me the trip was to Franklin, TN, which isn't too far from Lynchburg, so I turned the work trip into a little fun too. Before heading down, I signed up for the Angel's Share tour on Thursday morning. Wednesday after the work meetings were over I drove around Franklin TN a bit and did some whiskey hunting, checking out the local liquor stores to see what I could find. I ended up picking up a bottle of Wheeler's Raid, which is a local whiskey out of Nolensville, TN I believe, on the recommendation of a coworker.

I also managed to find a bottle of the [Jack Daniel's Tennessee Taster's Series High Angel's Share](https://collectorofjack.com/HighAngelsShare) sitting on a shelf. I jumped at the opportunity to buy it, I wish I had a picture of the receipt, I honestly can't recall what I paid for it, it was either $42 or $65. Either way, the High Angel's Share Taster's is one of the hardest to find, and I found it to be an excellent drinker, so picking up another one was worth the price. I did stumble on another bottle of it at Celebration Liquors in Lynchburg later, but they wanted $150 for it.

After hunting around a few stores I met up with a lady named Debbie who I had been speaking with on Facebook for over 6 months. She had reached out late last year when I had posted on a thread that I had a 2019 Holiday Calendar that I would be willing to sell/trade. I told her I would hold on to it for her, and when I made a trip out to TN (originally planned to go in December) I would bring it for her. Earlier this year I reached out and asked her to try to find me the latest two Tennessee Taster's bottles, the Jamaican Allspice and the 14E19 "Twin" Blend | Whiskey. The Jamaican Allspice bottle was one I was pretty sure that I could find, but the Twin blend was going to be harder, as it was rumored to be a much smaller release.

Debbie came through, we met at a gas station and exchanged prizes had a nice chat about all things Jack Daniel's while there. I mentioned that I had picked up the Angel's Share bottle and told her that I thought there was one more there if she wanted it, I really hope she was able to get it!

From there I headed south towards Lynchburg, I had grand visions of trying to be down there around Sunset to get some photos, unfortunately those visions weren't quite met though I did get some decent shots you can see below. I got down there a little later than I had hoped, and being down in the valley/hollow sunset is kinda hard to grasp due to all the shade from the hills and trees. I did spend quite a bit of time driving around the hills of Lynchburg getting to see some areas I've never seen before. I came across one field of vegetables that had a large group of menonite women/girls sitting in a circle. It really would have made the coolest picture, but I didn't want to be the creepy guy taking photos of them in a field so I just kept driving by.

As I was passing through a small town of Petersburg, TN I stopped to take a photo or two of the town square. I talked to a local artist who was out walking his 8 month old shepard/lab mix Skippy.
