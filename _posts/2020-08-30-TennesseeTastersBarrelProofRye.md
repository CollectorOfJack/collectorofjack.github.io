In July of 2019 Jack Daniel’s released the fourth bottle in their Tennessee Tasters’ series, Barrel Proof Rye, Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey.

## The label reads:
> After tasting our Tennessee Rye Whiskey in its purst form - straight from the barrel - we longed to share it with our firneds. Maturing at the highest reached of barrel house #1-05 delivers a deep copper hue and a nose that opens with an aroma full of smoke and raisin, while each sip lingerswith moolasses, sawn oak, and bold rye spice. 
> \- Master Taster: Michael Myers
