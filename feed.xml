&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-label-reads&quot;&gt;The label reads:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After tasting our Tennessee Rye Whiskey in its purst form - straight from the barrel - we longed to share it with our firneds. Maturing at the highest reached of barrel house #1-05 delivers a deep copper hue and a nose that opens with an aroma full of smoke and raisin, while each sip lingerswith moolasses, sawn oak, and bold rye spice.
- Master Taster: Michael Myers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all the Tasters’ Series these bottles were originally only available in Tennessee. You can still find it in select TN stores for $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release:&lt;/strong&gt; 2019&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; 127.6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 375ml&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $39.99&lt;/p&gt;

The first bottle that I learned about is one I hope to write about in the next week or two, as I don’t have it yet, but today I received my first bottle from the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bottle was put together for the 2020 Daytona Beach Bike Week. The bottle is a single barrel selection chosen by the group, and contains a number of very cool things! The first, most noticeable item is the custom sleeve, with a photoshopped picture combining Easy Rider and the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also contains a hang tag reading “Daytona Beach Bike Week 2020”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains a sticker, a coaster, and a custom coin, along with an etched bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front of the coin reads the same as the logo on the sleeve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daytona Beach, Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;79th Bike Week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World’s Largest Motorcycle Event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The etched bottle reads the same as the coaster, and the back of the coin:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daytona Beach Bike Week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ride Responsibly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottles &amp;amp; Throttles Don’t Mix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up ordering two of these bottles, and 3 extra sleeves. As I’ve gotten into the various Facebook groups I’ve seen these custom bottles and sleeves that have “scenes”, and when you have multiple boxes next to each other you can see the full scene, you can see this in the photos below as I have a shot of one of the sleeves fully spread out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look forward to partaking in future bottle sales that these groups do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottled: &lt;/strong&gt;March 10, 2020&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barrel Number:&lt;/strong&gt; 20-01418&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rick No.:&lt;/strong&gt; L-17&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release&lt;/strong&gt;: March 2020&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;: 94&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: 750ml&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $75/bottle&lt;/p&gt;

This post contains an overview of how I planned, how the event went and what lessons learned for future events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest hurdle to this event was just picking a date, for months I haven’t been able to get a date on the calendar, so in late January I threw one up (February 7th) and created a private Facebook event with info. I then sent the invite out to a small group of friends, some of which I had been talking about the event with for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Facebook I included a list of various bottles that I had acquired for the purpose of drinking over the past year, including selections of Jack Daniel’s, and non Jack Daniel’s bottles. I also requested that everyone bring an unopened bottle of their own, an if they felt like leaving it afterward they could. I ended up extending the invites out to 11 people, 8 of whom were able to make it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I neared the date I started prepping some things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I cleaned all my whiskey glasses, and wine glasses (not for use, but because they hadn’t been washed in…. years) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I purchased some new tasting glasses, 8 of them, shaped like Glencairn glasses, but not the brand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I did a little reading on how best to host a whiskey tasting. (Google it) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I posted a link to an article about “infinity” bottles, or the idea of filling up a decanter with a variety of different whiskeys, either when a bottle is opened, or as a bottle nears it’s completion. I suggested everyone bring a decanter and we could see about filling them up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I changed my mind about everyone bringing a decanter, and decided that I was going to buy some moonshine bottles and personalize them for the event (see the photos below, I think they turned out great).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made a selection of ice for the event, for anyone who wanted ice in their glasses (not everyone did).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5pm that evening I headed to the local grocery store, hoping to score some snacks, and hoping to score some whiskey for the night. In the local Bourbon Facebook group there were substantiated rumors that you could find some Weller’s Reserve and Eagle Rare at the Dierberg’s around town, so I headed to the Wildwood location with hopes of finding one or both. I was able to fill up the cart with snacks, and a bottle of the Dierberg’s Single Barrel selection of the Eagle Rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final prep for the night of including getting the dining room table extended and bringing extra chairs up from the basement. I also picked up some crackers and pizza bites to warm up, in case anyone was hungry for something. The pizza bites didn’t last an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Event Experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come the night of I was ready about an hour before the scheduled start time, so I sat down to read my copy of The Whiskey Advocate that mysteriously showed up in my mailbox a week ago. When the first guests showed up we took a seat in the kitchen and caught up a bit waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As everyone showed up, all bringing a bottle of their choice, I gave a tour of the basement where I keep my “undrinkables”, my Jack Daniel’s collection. From there we took our seats at the dining room table, the location for the tasting, and I passed out the custom decanters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone got to choose a glass from the table, and then I tried to determine what we would start with. My original list on the invite had probably 12 different bottles of mine that I wanted to use, but I quickly realized that wasn’t going to be realistic, so we started with the guest provided bottles and mixed in 4 or 5 of mine throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone got a “dram”, a small pour, supposed to be 3/4 of an OZ, but unmeasured on my pours. We went in the following order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eagle Rare (90 Proof) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knob Creek Smoked Maple (90 proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tamdhu Scotch (96 Proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New Riff Kentucky Straight Rye Bottled In Bond (100 proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breckenridge Bourbon Whiskey (86 proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sons of Erin Irish Whiskey (92 Proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Woodford Reserve (90.4 Proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye (86 Proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blanton’s (93 Proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jack Daniel’s Heritage Barrel 2019 (100 Proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold (80 proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;George Dickel Bottled in Bond (100 proof)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the tasting a few of us tried Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie, a scottish barley, which we mostly immediately regretted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had quite the variety of things to choose from on our first tasting. In the future we’ll have to decide if we want to try that many in one go again or not. Overall consensus was that the Blanton’s was the best. After that it was mixed, but I think the Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold was extra smooth and drinkable. Definitely glad we cracked that one open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My buddy who brought the Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye brought me another bottle, we didn't open it, but I did get to keep it. It is a 100 Proof bottle of  The Legendary Hatfield &amp; McCoy Family Brand Whiskey. I spent a few minutes looking online, and no proof of this bottle's existance can be found (you can find the 80 proof version, but I don't think 100 proof ever went to retail), how cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One, have fun. This was a great damn time. Invite some good friends, and invite some people you might not know that well. If you can get everyone to bring/leave a bottle, you can build up your collection! Be prepared, there was no way I had enough glasses for 9 people to try 12 different drinks. What we ended up doing was putting a bowl on each end of the table, and a pitcher of water. Rinsing the glasses out in between drams. This worked out pretty well, though I’m sure purists might cringe at the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing an infinite bottle/decanter might not make sense at a tasting like this, maybe that comes with some sort of a bring a bottle/trade pours type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I do this again in the future, no, not if, WHEN I do this again in the future, I will have to come up with another parting gift for everyone who attends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am already trying to figure out when the next one is, likely in April 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking I’ve got enough special edition Jack Daniel’s bottles we can crack open (in my drinkable selection) that we might just do a Night Dedicated To Jack Daniels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been threatening for months that I was going to have a whiskey tasting event, this past Friday I finally did it. This post contains an overview of how I planned, how the event went and what lessons learned for future events.PlanningThe biggest hurdle to this event was just picking a date, for months I haven’t been able to get a date on the calendar, so in late January I threw one up (February 7th) and created a private Facebook event with info. I then sent the invite out to a small group of friends, some of which I had been talking about the event with for months. In the Facebook I included a list of various bottles that I had acquired for the purpose of drinking over the past year, including selections of Jack Daniel’s, and non Jack Daniel’s bottles. I also requested that everyone bring an unopened bottle of their own, an if they felt like leaving it afterward they could. I ended up extending the invites out to 11 people, 8 of whom were able to make it. As I neared the date I started prepping some things.I cleaned all my whiskey glasses, and wine glasses (not for use, but because they hadn’t been washed in…. years) I purchased some new tasting glasses, 8 of them, shaped like Glencairn glasses, but not the brand.I did a little reading on how best to host a whiskey tasting. (Google it) I posted a link to an article about “infinity” bottles, or the idea of filling up a decanter with a variety of different whiskeys, either when a bottle is opened, or as a bottle nears it’s completion. I suggested everyone bring a decanter and we could see about filling them up.I changed my mind about everyone bringing a decanter, and decided that I was going to buy some moonshine bottles and personalize them for the event (see the photos below, I think they turned out great).Made a selection of ice for the event, for anyone who wanted ice in their glasses (not everyone did).At 5pm that evening I headed to the local grocery store, hoping to score some snacks, and hoping to score some whiskey for the night. In the local Bourbon Facebook group there were substantiated rumors that you could find some Weller’s Reserve and Eagle Rare at the Dierberg’s around town, so I headed to the Wildwood location with hopes of finding one or both. I was able to fill up the cart with snacks, and a bottle of the Dierberg’s Single Barrel selection of the Eagle Rare.Final prep for the night of including getting the dining room table extended and bringing extra chairs up from the basement. I also picked up some crackers and pizza bites to warm up, in case anyone was hungry for something. The pizza bites didn’t last an hour.Event ExperienceCome the night of I was ready about an hour before the scheduled start time, so I sat down to read my copy of The Whiskey Advocate that mysteriously showed up in my mailbox a week ago. When the first guests showed up we took a seat in the kitchen and caught up a bit waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive.As everyone showed up, all bringing a bottle of their choice, I gave a tour of the basement where I keep my “undrinkables”, my Jack Daniel’s collection. From there we took our seats at the dining room table, the location for the tasting, and I passed out the custom decanters. Everyone got to choose a glass from the table, and then I tried to determine what we would start with. My original list on the invite had probably 12 different bottles of mine that I wanted to use, but I quickly realized that wasn’t going to be realistic, so we started with the guest provided bottles and mixed in 4 or 5 of mine throughout the night.Everyone got a “dram”, a small pour, supposed to be 3/4 of an OZ, but unmeasured on my pours. We went in the following order:Eagle Rare (90 Proof) Knob Creek Smoked Maple (90 proof)Tamdhu Scotch (96 Proof)New Riff Kentucky Straight Rye Bottled In Bond (100 proof)Breckenridge Bourbon Whiskey (86 proof)Sons of Erin Irish Whiskey (92 Proof)Woodford Reserve (90.4 Proof)Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye (86 Proof)Blanton’s (93 Proof)Jack Daniel’s Heritage Barrel 2019 (100 Proof)Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold (80 proof)George Dickel Bottled in Bond (100 proof)Outside of the tasting a few of us tried Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie, a scottish barley, which we mostly immediately regretted. We had quite the variety of things to choose from on our first tasting. In the future we’ll have to decide if we want to try that many in one go again or not. Overall consensus was that the Blanton’s was the best. After that it was mixed, but I think the Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold was extra smooth and drinkable. Definitely glad we cracked that one open.My buddy who brought the Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye brought me another bottle, we didn't open it, but I did get to keep it. It is a 100 Proof bottle of The Legendary Hatfield &amp; McCoy Family Brand Whiskey. I spent a few minutes looking online, and no proof of this bottle's existance can be found (you can find the 80 proof version, but I don't think 100 proof ever went to retail), how cool is that?Lessons LearnedOne, have fun. This was a great damn time. Invite some good friends, and invite some people you might not know that well. If you can get everyone to bring/leave a bottle, you can build up your collection!

Two bottles of unmatured Old No. 7, one BEFORE Charcoal Mellowing and one AFTER Charcoal Mellowing, along with a small bottle of Hard Sugar Maple Charcoal in between the two bottles. The BEFORE bottle on the left, the AFTER on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It ends up the package was exclusive to Tennessee, and could be found at a variety of locations around the state. I lined up a set with a local in Lynchburg, and planned to get it in the mail, trading for a Scenes of Lynchburg series bottle, but got cold feet before shipping and ended up committing to the other party that I would trade in person next time I make it to Lynchburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November I made a trek south from St. Louis down to Memphis and picked up two packages of the Before and After set, maintaining my intention of getting the third set mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottles and charcoal come in a black box, the bottles with a white label with black text. The bottles are 375ml, with whiskey aged only one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set has a lot of writing on it, so I am not going to transcribe all of that writing this time around, but will include a couple of interesting bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasting Directions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Pour an ounce of our before charcoal mellowing whiskey into a tasking glass. Without mellowing, it’s nose has extra cereal notes and its taste is more harsh and oily in character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Pour an ounce of our after charcoal mellowing whiskey into a second glass. Because this whiskey has been mellowed drop by drop, you’ll notice its nose and taste is smoother and cleaner. It is absent the grainy character of the before mellowing Jack Daniel’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last thing, the bottle mentions a URL, jackdaniels.com/BEFORE-AFTER but as of December 28th, 2019, the URL only leads to a 404 page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release&lt;/strong&gt;: 2019&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;: 80&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: 375ml (x2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $29.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In the fall of 2019 rumors started swirling online of a new release available at the White Rabbit Bottleshop in Lynchburg, of a Before and After set. Two bottles of unmatured Old No. 7, one BEFORE Charcoal Mellowing and one AFTER Charcoal Mellowing, along with a small bottle of Hard Sugar Maple Charcoal in between the two bottles. The BEFORE bottle on the left, the AFTER on the right.It ends up the package was exclusive to Tennessee, and could be found at a variety of locations around the state. I lined up a set with a local in Lynchburg, and planned to get it in the mail, trading for a Scenes of Lynchburg series bottle, but got cold feet before shipping and ended up committing to the other party that I would trade in person next time I make it to Lynchburg.In November I made a trek south from St. Louis down to Memphis and picked up two packages of the Before and After set, maintaining my intention of getting the third set mentioned above.The bottles and charcoal come in a black box, the bottles with a white label with black text. The bottles are 375ml, with whiskey aged only one day.This set has a lot of writing on it, so I am not going to transcribe all of that writing this time around, but will include a couple of interesting bits.Tasting Directions1) Pour an ounce of our before charcoal mellowing whiskey into a tasking glass. Without mellowing, it’s nose has extra cereal notes and its taste is more harsh and oily in character.2) Pour an ounce of our after charcoal mellowing whiskey into a second glass. Because this whiskey has been mellowed drop by drop, you’ll notice its nose and taste is smoother and cleaner. It is absent the grainy character of the before mellowing Jack Daniel’s.One last thing, the bottle mentions a URL, jackdaniels.com/BEFORE-AFTER but as of December 28th, 2019, the URL only leads to a 404 page.Release: 2019Proof: 80Size: 375ml (x2)Price: $29.99</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2019 Jack Daniel’s Holiday Countdown Calendar</title><link href="https://collectorofjack.com/2019AdventCalendar" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2019 Jack Daniel’s Holiday Countdown Calendar" /><published>2019-12-19T16:41:16+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-19T16:41:16+00:00</updated><id>https://collectorofjack.com/2019AdventCalendar</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collectorofjack.com/2019AdventCalendar">&lt;p&gt;For 2019 Jack Daniel’s has brought their holiday (advent) calendar across the pond to the United States!

In &lt;a href=&quot;https://collectorofjack.com/HeritageBarrel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2018 JD had a special release for this limited bottling, consisting of a rumored two hundred barrels, bottled in September 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2019, Jack Daniels has once again released Heritage Barrel, this time, aging it 1 year more, and the rumors in collecting communities say that they bottled fewer barrels this year. Bottles were bottled on both 9/9/2019 and 9/10/2019, though rumors also say that there were fewer bottles bottled on the 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a bottle this year was difficult to say the least. I spent weeks driving to liquor stores, calling liquor stores, and looking online, to see if I could find a bottle. I got the run around at the Chesterfield Total Wine. Depending on who I asked I was told it hadn’t come yet, or that it came weeks ago and was already gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lukas Liquors in Ellisville, MO came through though. They were super responsive on twitter, and super helpful when I was in the store multiple times inquiring about the bottle. They reached out via DM on twitter on Thursday, saying that the bottles had arrived and they were holding one for me! I took off at lunch and went to pick it up, not wanting to risk the bottle being sold to someone else!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottle itself doesn’t vary much, if at all, from the 2018 release, so we won’t bother covering all the details again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://collectorofjack.com/HeritageBarrel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;you can check out the 2018 post for those&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up paying $80/each for my two bottles. Wait, what? Yeah, two bottles. Last year I only found one, and didn’t get to crack it open. This year I got two, with the idea that I’ll be tasting one of these. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release&lt;/strong&gt;: Fall 2019&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;: 100&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: 750ml&lt;/p&gt;

In 2018 JD had a special release for this limited bottling, consisting of a rumored two hundred barrels, bottled in September 2018.For 2019, Jack Daniels has once again released Heritage Barrel, this time, aging it 1 year more, and the rumors in collecting communities say that they bottled fewer barrels this year. Bottles were bottled on both 9/9/2019 and 9/10/2019, though rumors also say that there were fewer bottles bottled on the 10th.Finding a bottle this year was difficult to say the least. I spent weeks driving to liquor stores, calling liquor stores, and looking online, to see if I could find a bottle. I got the run around at the Chesterfield Total Wine. Depending on who I asked I was told it hadn’t come yet, or that it came weeks ago and was already gone.Lukas Liquors in Ellisville, MO came through though. They were super responsive on twitter, and super helpful when I was in the store multiple times inquiring about the bottle. They reached out via DM on twitter on Thursday, saying that the bottles had arrived and they were holding one for me! I took off at lunch and went to pick it up, not wanting to risk the bottle being sold to someone else!The bottle itself doesn’t vary much, if at all, from the 2018 release, so we won’t bother covering all the details again, you can check out the 2018 post for those.I ended up paying $80/each for my two bottles. Wait, what? Yeah, two bottles. Last year I only found one, and didn’t get to crack it open. This year I got two, with the idea that I’ll be tasting one of these.
