I started a new job last year, about a week after the world shut down for the pandemic, so work trips have been on hold for quite some time, that and the last employer stopped my travelling, so I hadn’t been on the road for work in quite some time. It was great to get out and meet some fellow employees and customers face to face.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Jack Daniel’s Scenes From Lynchburg Number Five</title><link href="https://collectorofjack.com/ScenesFromLynchburgFive" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jack Daniel’s Scenes From Lynchburg Number Five" /><published>2021-03-19T08:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-19T08:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://collectorofjack.com/Scenes-From-Lynchburg-Five</id><author><name>Chris Hammond</name></author><summary type="html">The Jack Daniel’s Scenes from Lynchburg Series is a collection of 8 bottles, released every year from 2003 to 2011 (skipping 2010).

Jim Beam released a bottle celebrating this and I was fortunate enough to have a family member in massachusetts pick one up for me. I’m a HUGE Red Sox fan, always have been, even went to Game 4 of the 2004 World Series to see them win their first Championship in 86 years, so getting my hands on this bottle was exciting. For some reason I never got around to posting about it though, even though I took the pictures for it back in 2019!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blackened American Whiskey Batch 106 S&amp;amp;M2</title><link href="https://collectorofjack.com/BlackenedBatch106" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blackened American Whiskey Batch 106 S&amp;amp;M2" /><published>2021-02-14T20:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-14T20:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://collectorofjack.com/Blackened-Whiskey-Batch-106</id><author><name>Chris Hammond</name></author><summary type="html">In getting ready for this post I realized this is the first time I’ve actually blogged about Blackened.
