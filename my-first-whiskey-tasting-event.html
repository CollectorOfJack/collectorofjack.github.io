						<p>
							I’ve been threatening for months that I was going to have a
							whiskey tasting event, this past Friday I finally did it. This
							post contains an overview of how I planned, how the event went and
							what lessons learned for future events.
						</p>
						<h2>Planning</h2>

						<p>
							The biggest hurdle to this event was just picking a date, for
							months I haven’t been able to get a date on the calendar, so in
							late January I threw one up (February 7th) and created a private
							Facebook event with info. I then sent the invite out to a small
							group of friends, some of which I had been talking about the event
							with for months.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the Facebook I included a list of various bottles that I had
							acquired for the purpose of drinking over the past year, including
							selections of Jack Daniel’s, and non Jack Daniel’s bottles. I also
							requested that everyone bring an unopened bottle of their own, an
							if they felt like leaving it afterward they could. I ended up
							extending the invites out to 11 people, 8 of whom were able to
							make it.
						</p>
						<p>As I neared the date I started prepping some things.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								I cleaned all my whiskey glasses, and wine glasses (not for use,
								but because they hadn’t been washed in…. years)
							</li>
							<li>
								I purchased some new tasting glasses, 8 of them, shaped like
								Glencairn glasses, but not the brand.
							</li>
							<li>
								I did a little reading on how best to host a whiskey tasting.
								(Google it)
							</li>
							<li>
								I posted a link to an article about “infinity” bottles, or the
								idea of filling up a decanter with a variety of different
								whiskeys, either when a bottle is opened, or as a bottle nears
								it’s completion. I suggested everyone bring a decanter and we
								could see about filling them up.
							</li>
							<li>
								I changed my mind about everyone bringing a decanter, and
								decided that I was going to buy some moonshine bottles and
								personalize them for the event (see the photos below, I think
								they turned out great).
							</li>
							<li>
								Made a selection of ice for the event, for anyone who wanted ice
								in their glasses (not everyone did).
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							At 5pm that evening I headed to the local grocery store, hoping to
							score some snacks, and hoping to score some whiskey for the night.
							In the local Bourbon Facebook group there were substantiated
							rumors that you could find some Weller’s Reserve and Eagle Rare at
							the Dierberg’s around town, so I headed to the Wildwood location
							with hopes of finding one or both. I was able to fill up the cart
							with snacks, and a bottle of the Dierberg’s Single Barrel
							selection of the Eagle Rare.
						</p>
						<p>
							Final prep for the night of including getting the dining room
							table extended and bringing extra chairs up from the basement. I
							also picked up some crackers and pizza bites to warm up, in case
							anyone was hungry for something. The pizza bites didn’t last an
							hour.
						</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<h2>Event Experience</h2>
						<p>
							Come the night of I was ready about an hour before the scheduled
							start time, so I sat down to read my copy of The Whiskey Advocate
							that mysteriously showed up in my mailbox a week ago. When the
							first guests showed up we took a seat in the kitchen and caught up
							a bit waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive.
						</p>
						<p>
							As everyone showed up, all bringing a bottle of their choice, I
							gave a tour of the basement where I keep my “undrinkables”, my
							Jack Daniel’s collection. From there we took our seats at the
							dining room table, the location for the tasting, and I passed out
							the custom decanters.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everyone got to choose a glass from the table, and then I tried to
							determine what we would start with. My original list on the invite
							had probably 12 different bottles of mine that I wanted to use,
							but I quickly realized that wasn’t going to be realistic, so we
							started with the guest provided bottles and mixed in 4 or 5 of
							mine throughout the night.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everyone got a “dram”, a small pour, supposed to be 3/4 of an OZ,
							but unmeasured on my pours. We went in the following order:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Eagle Rare (90 Proof)</li>
							<li>Knob Creek Smoked Maple (90 proof)</li>
							<li>Tamdhu Scotch (96 Proof)</li>
							<li>
								New Riff Kentucky Straight Rye Bottled In Bond (100 proof)
							</li>
							<li>Breckenridge Bourbon Whiskey (86 proof)</li>
							<li>Sons of Erin Irish Whiskey (92 Proof)</li>
							<li>Woodford Reserve (90.4 Proof)</li>
							<li>Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye (86 Proof)</li>
							<li>Blanton’s (93 Proof)</li>
							<li>Jack Daniel’s Heritage Barrel 2019 (100 Proof)</li>
							<li>Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold (80 proof)</li>
							<li>George Dickel Bottled in Bond (100 proof)</li>
						</ol>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>
							Outside of the tasting a few of us tried Bruichladdich The Classic
							Laddie, a scottish barley, which we mostly immediately regretted.
						</p>
						<p>
							We had quite the variety of things to choose from on our first
							tasting. In the future we’ll have to decide if we want to try that
							many in one go again or not. Overall consensus was that the
							Blanton’s was the best. After that it was mixed, but I think the
							Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold was extra smooth and drinkable.
							Definitely glad we cracked that one open.
						</p>
						<p>
							My buddy who brought the Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye brought me
							another bottle, we didn't open it, but I did get to keep it. It is
							a 100 Proof bottle of The Legendary Hatfield & McCoy Family Brand
							Whiskey. I spent a few minutes looking online, and no proof of
							this bottle's existance can be found (you can find the 80 proof
							version, but I don't think 100 proof ever went to retail), how
							cool is that?
						</p>
						<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

						<p>
							One, have fun. This was a great damn time. Invite some good
							friends, and invite some people you might not know that well. If
							you can get everyone to bring/leave a bottle, you can build up
							your collection! Be prepared, there was no way I had enough
							glasses for 9 people to try 12 different drinks. What we ended up
							doing was putting a bowl on each end of the table, and a pitcher
							of water. Rinsing the glasses out in between drams. This worked
							out pretty well, though I’m sure purists might cringe at the idea.
						</p>
						<p>
							Doing an infinite bottle/decanter might not make sense at a
							tasting like this, maybe that comes with some sort of a bring a
							bottle/trade pours type of thing.
						</p>
						<p>
							If I do this again in the future, no, not if, WHEN I do this again
							in the future, I will have to come up with another parting gift
							for everyone who attends.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am already trying to figure out when the next one is, likely in
							April 2020.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thinking I’ve got enough special edition Jack Daniel’s bottles we
							can crack open (in my drinkable selection) that we might just do a
							Night Dedicated To Jack Daniels.
