Welcome to the Jack Daniel's Collector Blog,JackDanielsCollector,"<div class=""image-wrap""><img src=""/images/1/post-bg1.jpg"" alt=""Welcome to Collector of Jack""></div><p>I started out my journey with Jack Daniel's at a young age. My father would have a Jack and Coke, every night, after work. One and done, but as well as I can remember, it was, and still is, a nightly ritual. I might have snuck a taste as a kid, but I wasn’t a kid who drank in high school, it wasn’t until college until I really had my first drink.</p><p>I was in a fraternity at a small engineering school in Missouri, it was in a small town, with a very skewed guy to girl ratio, so even though joining a fraternity had never crossed my mind prior to college, it made sense to me and built me into who I am today. While you might think there is a lot of drinking in a fraternity in college, it isn’t required, and it was never forced upon me. So when I did sit down to have my first drink, it was to a great surprise to my fraternity brothers. There was a group of guys, I can still remember the room, that were partaking in a 1/5th of Old No. 7, I sat down one evening and asked for my own glass, they were floored.</p><p>I didn’t plan to start drinking Jack Daniel’s that evening, but I ended up doing so, and thus setting my journey into the world of Tennessee Whiskey. While I don’t have the first bottle of Jack Daniel’s I purchased, I do have a couple of bottles that I purchased during my college years. I wish I could go back in time and buy 2, at the time I didn’t buy to collect, so the bottles from back then are all empty, but they are still mine. I’ll be documenting those bottles in blog posts in the future here on this new blog.</p><p>Why CollectorOfJack.com? I’ve been collecting Jack Daniel’s bottles for many years now, and while I am proud of my collection, there are definitely some gaps that I would like to fill. I’ve managed to acquire some extras over the years, and I’m hopeful that with this blog I’ll be able to find other like minded folks, who perhaps have bottles to fill my gaps and possibly need some of the extras that I have in my collection.</p><p>This is the first post in what will hopefully be many future posts, stay tuned as I document and acquire additional items to the collection.

Gentleman Jack Limited Edition Time Piece Bottle,GentlemanJackTimePiece,"<div class=""image-wrap""><img src=""/images/2/Day1-4.jpg"" alt=""Gentleman Jack Time Piece Limited Edition""></div><p>One of the things I want to do here on this blog is document the various Jack Daniel’s collectables, primarily bottles, that I’ve managed to acquire over time. This is the first post in that series.</p><p>In 2017, Jack Daniel’s announced/released a new bottle in the Gentleman Jack product line, called The Limited Edition Gentleman Jack, often referred to as the Time Piece. The bottle markings on the packaging of the bottle are reminiscent of the pocket watch that Jack Daniel carried around.</p><p>I had trouble trying to locate the bottle here in St. Louis, checking all the local liquor stores, along with the big box Total Wine locations. In March of 2018 I was driving to Georgia for an autocross event with a buddy of mine, and stopped to buy a car in Murfreesboro Tennessee. While at the dealer, I asked my sales guy where I could find a decent liquor store, so that I could try to find the Time Piece. He sent me a few streets over, and I found a bottle of Tennessee Rye which I hadn’t seen before, but no Time Piece to be found. It was getting late in the day, and I was hoping to try to swing by the Distillery (my buddy who drove me to Murfreesboro had headed down there while I was doing paperwork on the car), but I wasn’t sure if I could make it down before the White Rabbit bottle shop closed.</p><p>I decided I would try another liquor store on the way over to Lynchburg. At this store I asked the guys behind the counter if they had a Time Piece bottle. One guy said yes he did, but it was in his private collection, and not for sale. I looked around the store, picked up something there (can’t recall which bottle) and then checked out. While checking out he mentioned that there was a place near Shelbyville, called Celebration Liquors that might have the bottle. It was on my way to Lynchburg, so I decided I was for sure stopping when I got there. Upon arrival I looked around the store, but couldn’t find the bottle. I asked the girl behind the counter if she knew anything about the bottle, but she didn’t know what it was. If I recall correctly, she did however offer to call the owner, and he told her the bottle was right behind her.</p><p>We both had missed it sitting there on a shelf behind the counter. Score! I was able to purchase one bottle of the Gentleman Jack Limited Edition bottle, seen above on this post. What this hunt made me realize though, was that I wasn’t the only one out there collecting Jack Daniel’s gear. I realized that people collected, and even collected extras, so that they could “trade” for other items to add to their collections.</p><p>A few short weeks ago, I stopped by Total Wine on my way home from work one day, something I occasionally do just to see if they have anything JD related in stock that I don’t have. This time, they did, they had Time Piece bottles, and multiple! I picked one up, and walked to the register, paying about 50% of what I paid for the bottle in Shelbyville. By the time I got home I started kicking myself for not buying a few, when I stopped by that Total Wine again they were completely out. I ended up checking another TW location the next weekend and picked up 3 more bottles so that I could start creating a stock of items that I could trade in the future!</p><p>If you’re looking for a Gentleman Jack Limited Edition Time Piece bottle, check out my <a href=\""http://collectorofjack.com/WantedItems\"">Hunt List</a> to see if you have something I need, maybe we can trade!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Release</strong>: December 2017<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 100<br><strong>Size</strong>: 1L</p><div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/2/Day1-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/2/Day1-5.jpg""><img src=""/images/2/Day1-6.jpg""><img src=""/images/2/Day1-7.jpg""><img src=""/images/2/Day1-8.jpg""><img src=""/images/2/Day1-9.jpg""></div>",2019-06-18T14:58:04.8856113Z,html
Tennessee Tasters' High Angel's Share Barrels (2018),HighAngelsShare,"<div class=""image-wrap""><img src=""/images/3/AngelsShare-1.jpg"" alt=""Tennessee Taster's High Angel's Share""></div><p>In October 2018 Jack Daniel’s put out a press release announcing a new Tasters’ Series of bottles/releases. I won’t go into the full details of the press release, <a href=\""http://pressroom.jackdaniels.com/jack-daniels-launches-limited-edition-tennessee-tasters-selection/\"" target=\""_blank\"">you can read it here</a>, but I do want to document the releases as I acquire them!&nbsp; </p><p>Towards the end of the month they released the first two bottles in the series, High Angel’s Share Barrels and Smoked Hickory Finish. This post is about the High Angel’s Share Barrels release.</p><p>High Angel’s Share Barrels – whiskey barreled in January 2013 which offered an unusually low yield, presenting a unique and deep concentration of flavors with a dark color at 107-proof. Selected by Assistant Master Distiller and Master Taster Chris Fletcher. Available early-October.</p><p>These releases, are limited to around 24,000 bottles, and only available at the Distillery and in select stores in Tennessee. This had caused me to start looking at making a trip to Lynchburg to pick up some bottles for myself, but family events the past few weekends have prevented me from being able to make the 5-6 hour drive there (plus another 5-6 hours back).</p><p>This past Friday I found out that some fellow coworkers of mine were on their way to Nashville for a weekend getaway, so I reached out to them to ask them a huge favor, to do some hunting for me while they were there. I sent them a screen shot of the two new Tasters’ bottles, and asked them to see if they could find them while they were there.</p><p>Lucky for me they did! A big shout out to K&amp;K for picking them up for me. Here are the photos of the High Angel’s Share Barrel bottle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Release</strong>: October 2018<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 107<br><strong>Size</strong>: 375ml</p> <div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/3/AngelsShare-1.jpg""><img src=""/images/3/AngelsShare-2.jpg""><img src=""/images/3/AngelsShare-3.jpg""><img src=""/images/3/AngelsShare-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/3/AngelsShare-5.jpg""></div>",2019-06-18T15:07:41.1899158Z,html

The bottle is labelled as \""Tennessee Whiskey Finish with Charred Hickory Staves\"". </p><blockquote><p><strong>Smoked Hickory Finish</strong> – a fully matured whiskey finished with charred hickory staves for a smoky flavor at 100-proof, just in time for the 30<sup>th</sup> annual Jack Daniel’s World Championship Invitational BBQ which is held in Lynchburg on Oct. 27.

I do have two of each, with the original intention of keeping one and having the other for trading to fill my collection with missing items. If however I could come across some other bottles, I would likely try one out myself, only time will tell if that happens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Release</strong>: October 2018<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 100<br><strong>Size</strong>: 375ml</p><div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/4/HickorySmoked-1.jpg""><img src=""/images/4/HickorySmoked-2.jpg""><img src=""/images/4/HickorySmoked-3.jpg""><img src=""/images/4/HickorySmoked-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/4/HickorySmoked-5.jpg""></div>",2019-06-18T15:11:50.7105915Z,html
Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Heritage Barrel (2018),HeritageBarrel,"<div class=""image-wrap""><img src=""/images/5/HeritageBarrel-1.jpg"" alt=""Jack Daniel's Heritage Barrel 2018""></div><p>In late September 2018 Jack Daniel’s announced a new Special Release Tennessee Whiskey, Single Barrel Heritage Barrel.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>This release celebrates the early craftsmanship of the Jack Daniel Distillery. The whiskey is from uniquely crafted heavy-toast barrels and 100 proof barrel entry proof. <p>The \""Heritage Barrel\"" expression of Jack Daniel's Single Barrel was crafted with a low temperature, heavy toasted barrel which created a light but rich char full of deep flavor. A lower 100 proof entry proof allows our grain bill to assert itself creating a special Tennessee whiskey with notes of light baking spices, vanilla, and toasted oak with a long, lingering finish, aged to perfection at the top of one of the highest elevated barrelhouses, 1-09, on Coy Hill. What emerges is a flavorful and rich Tennessee Whiskey. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p align=\""right\""><a href=\""https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us/whiskey/limited/single-barrel-heritage-barrel\"" target=\""_blank\"">JackDaniels.com</a></p></blockquote><p>The included cardboard wrapped on the neck of the bottle, reads:</p><blockquote><p>Master Distiller Jeff Arnett and his team of whiskey makers created a truly unique whiskey for this special release of Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel.</p><p>The “Heritage Barrel” expression of Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel was crafted with a low temperature, heavy toasted barrel which creates a light but rich char full of deep flavor.

Lucas Liquors tells me (<a href=\""https://twitter.com/christoc/status/1063843217655951360\"" target=\""_blank\"">via twitter</a>) that they might be available here before Christmas. The gentleman at 141 Liquors tells me that his distributor says they won’t see any before May. Based on this info so far, I doubt they’ll make it to Missouri at all considering the release is limited to 200 total barrels. </p><p>I was fortunate enough to only stumble upon it online after doing some searching one weekend. I found it on a website called SipWhiskey.com, and while their communication/customer service left some things to be desired, and their packing of the bottle made me seriously question if it would still be intact when I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised that I received bottle in perfect shape. Unfortunately their website says they are out of stock now, but perhaps they will get it back in stock again soon. </p><p>Good luck hunting!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Release</strong>: Fall 2018<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 100<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml</p><div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/5/HeritageBarrel-1.jpg""><img src=""/images/5/HeritageBarrel-2.jpg""><img src=""/images/5/HeritageBarrel-3.jpg""><img src=""/images/5/HeritageBarrel-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/5/HeritageBarrel-5.jpg""></div>",2019-06-18T15:18:24.4110466Z,html

The limited edition bottles were essentially Jack Daniel’s single barrel bottles, but this collection consisted of whiskey from the barrels used in the Holiday Barrel Tree built near Lynchburg Tennessee’s town square. I was fortunate enough to collect all 4 in the series, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Stay tuned for posts about each of them as we get into this 2018 holiday season.</p><p>The 2011 bottle came in a matte black box, with a clam shell opening on the top.&nbsp; The front of the box reads “<a href=\""https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us/whiskey/limited/2011-holiday-select\"" target=\""_blank\"">Jack Daniel’s Holiday Select 2011 Limited Edition</a>”.

Each barrel is truly unique and we hope the bottle you’ve selected helps make your holiday special. – Jeff Arnette, Master Distiller</p></blockquote><p>The shape of the bottle is a bit different than the earlier Holiday Select bottles as the Jack Daniel’s signature is towards the top, instead off on the right side as with the earlier bottles. The labelling on the bottle is a mixture of white and gold, and reads Limited Edition 2014 Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Holiday Select Small Batch. The holly berry from earlier releases is missing.</p><p>In the photos below you’ll see two different bottles, one still boxed up, and one that I drank.

I gave most of the bottles away as gifts to friends and family, but kept three bottles for myself, one of which I chose to drink. That would be the empty bottle in the photos below.</p><p>The 2014 bottle is 48% Alcohol, or 96 Proof, down from 98 the year before.

This bottle was the first in what has become 3 releases of their Rye product. Stay tuned for future blog posts about the Rested Rye and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye. Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye is Master Distiller Jeff Arnett’s attempt at a new mash bill, this one consisting of 70 percent rye, 18 percent corn and 12 percent malted barley. </p><p>The bottle is the shape of Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel, with minimal labelling. The bottle is embossed with “Jack Daniel Distillery”&nbsp; The front of the label consists of:</p><blockquote><p>“Batch No: 001<br>Distiller’s run<br>MADE IN TENNESSEE<br>UNAGED TENNESSEE RYE</p><p>Aged (X’d out barrel) Years <br>SPIRITS DISTILLED FROM GRAIN</p><p>40% ALC.

This is my exploration into the intriguing flavor drawn from premier rye. Only a limited number of bottles will be available so that the majority of the new rye can mature in our barrelhouses for a future release. This unaged rye offers a spicy, surprisingly sweet character that I hope you will enjoy.<br><br>Master Distiller: Jeff Arnett Sept 2012”</p></blockquote><p>Jack Daniel’s Unaged Tennessee Rye was released in December 2012 at the White Rabbit Bottle Shop and limited around the country in select markets. </p><p>Availability as of January 6, 2018 appears to be limited.

As the Rye has matured, we’ve gone from Unaged to Rested and now on to Single Barrel. In 2016 Jack Daniel’s released the Single Barrel Rye, a 94 proof Tennessee Rye Whiskey. Depending on where you acquired it, it may or may not have come with a box. The front of the box is adorned with:</p><blockquote><p>“Jack Daniel’s <br>Uniquely Crafted / Handmade Barrels<br>Single Barrel Rye<br>Tennessee Rye Whiskey”</p></blockquote><p> The side of the box reads:</p><blockquote><p>“Single Barrel Rye<br>Hand Selected<br>Jack Daniel Distillery<br>Lynchburg, Tenn.”</p></blockquote><p>Towards the top of the rear box, the same graphic that adorns the front is found, below that you find:</p><blockquote><p>“Single Barrel Tennessee Rye Whiskey draws its wonderful flavor from a unique 70% rye grain bill, matured to perfection in our handmade oak barrels, positioned in the upper reached of our barrelhouses. Bottled at 94$, this is a big bold rye that does not overpower. Complex flavors of ripe fruit mingle with light toasted oak notes, allowing the rye grain to shine through, creating a taste rich with spice and a pleasant lingering finish. Enjoy this Single Barrel Rye neat, on the rocks, or in classic rye cocktails.”</p></blockquote><p>Inside the box you will find a bottled in the current Single Barrel form. The label reads the same as the front of the box (listed above) with the additional text:</p><blockquote><p>“47% ALC/VOL 750ML<br>LYNCHBURG TENN.<br>MASTER DISTILLED”</p></blockquote><p>Our bottle was bottled 2/25/2016 from barrel no. 16-1397, Rick No. L-4. </p><p>Single Barrel Rye can be found on store shelves for $50 (1/13/2019).</p><p><strong>Release</strong>: 2016<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 94<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml<br><strong>Price:</strong> $49.95</p><div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/16/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye-1.jpg""><img src=""/images/16/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye-2.jpg""><img src=""/images/16/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye-3.jpg""><img src=""/images/16/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/16/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye-5.jpg""><img src=""/images/16/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye-6.jpg""><img src=""/images/16/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye-7.jpg""><img src=""/images/16/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye-8.jpg""></div>",2019-06-18T17:26:34.1045729Z,html

In <a href=\""https://collectorofjack.com/HeritageBarrel\"" target=\""_blank\"">2018 JD had a special release for this limited bottling, consisting of a rumored two hundred barrels, bottled in September 2018</a>.</p><p>For 2019, Jack Daniels has once again released Heritage Barrel, this time, aging it 1 year more, and the rumors in collecting communities say that they bottled fewer barrels this year. Bottles were bottled on both 9/9/2019 and 9/10/2019, though rumors also say that there were fewer bottles bottled on the 10th.</p><p>Finding a bottle this year was difficult to say the least. I spent weeks driving to liquor stores, calling liquor stores, and looking online, to see if I could find a bottle. I got the run around at the Chesterfield Total Wine. Depending on who I asked I was told it hadn’t come yet, or that it came weeks ago and was already gone.</p><p>Lukas Liquors in Ellisville, MO came through though. They were super responsive on twitter, and super helpful when I was in the store multiple times inquiring about the bottle. They reached out via DM on twitter on Thursday, saying that the bottles had arrived and they were holding one for me! I took off at lunch and went to pick it up, not wanting to risk the bottle being sold to someone else!</p><p>The bottle itself doesn’t vary much, if at all, from the 2018 release, so we won’t bother covering all the details again, <a href=\""https://collectorofjack.com/HeritageBarrel\"" target=\""_blank\"">you can check out the 2018 post for those</a>.</p><p>I ended up paying $80/each for my two bottles.

They’ve also made it available elsewhere around the globe this year as well, where I believe primarily over the past couple of years it was only available in the UK (I could be wrong on that fact).</p><p>I spent quite a bit of time this fall trying to find this calendar in the St. Louis market, but no stores that I talked to knew anything about it, and from what I can tell no one in the St. Louis market got any in for sale. I ended up driving to Memphis a few weeks back and picked up 3 for myself. 1 to open (see my instagram feed for the daily opening), 1 to keep, and 1 to have as a tradeable item in the future.</p><p>The countdown calendar comes with 20 50ML bottles, and 4 shot glasses.

While old traditions warm the heart, there’s something special about starting a new one. We hope that as you open a new calendar door, you’ll share a toast with the folks closest to you.</p></blockquote><p>Each day, the 1st through the 24th, has a separate door that you open to find the present for the day. In the first week or so you'll find three shot glasses, the fourth one comes later in the month. The doors can be a little difficult to open without causing bending of the cardboard, but if you're careful it can be done. \t</p><p>If you can get your hands on one of these countdown calendars, enjoy!

Jack Daniel’s Before and After Release,before-after,"<div class=""image-wrap""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-1.jpg"" alt=""Jack Daniel's Distillery 150th Anniversary""></div><p>In the fall of 2019 rumors started swirling online of a new release available at the White Rabbit Bottleshop in Lynchburg, of a Before and After set. Two bottles of unmatured Old No. 7, one BEFORE Charcoal Mellowing and one AFTER Charcoal Mellowing, along with a small bottle of Hard Sugar Maple Charcoal in between the two bottles. The BEFORE bottle on the left, the AFTER on the right.</p><p>It ends up the package was exclusive to Tennessee, and could be found at a variety of locations around the state. I lined up a set with a local in Lynchburg, and planned to get it in the mail, trading for a Scenes of Lynchburg series bottle, but got cold feet before shipping and ended up committing to the other party that I would trade in person next time I make it to Lynchburg.</p><p>In November I made a trek south from St. Louis down to Memphis and picked up two packages of the Before and After set, maintaining my intention of getting the third set mentioned above.</p><p>The bottles and charcoal come in a black box, the bottles with a white label with black text. The bottles are 375ml, with whiskey aged only one day.</p><p>This set has a lot of writing on it, so I am not going to transcribe all of that writing this time around, but will include a couple of interesting bits.</p><blockquote><p>Tasting Directions</p><p>1) Pour an ounce of our before charcoal mellowing whiskey into a tasking glass. Without mellowing, it’s nose has extra cereal notes and its taste is more harsh and oily in character.</p><p>2) Pour an ounce of our after charcoal mellowing whiskey into a second glass. Because this whiskey has been mellowed drop by drop, you’ll notice its nose and taste is smoother and cleaner. It is absent the grainy character of the before mellowing Jack Daniel’s.</p></blockquote><p>One last thing, the bottle mentions a URL, jackdaniels.com/BEFORE-AFTER but as of December 28th, 2019, the URL only leads to a 404 page.</p><p><strong>Release</strong>: 2019<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 80<br><strong>Size</strong>: 375ml (x2)<br><strong>Price:</strong> $29.99</p><div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-1.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-2.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-3.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-5.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-6.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-7.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-8.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-9.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-10.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-11.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-12.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-13.jpg""><img src=""/images/28/BeforeAndAfter-14.jpg""></div>",2019-12-29T05:11:58.2939368Z,html
My first whiskey tasting event,a-jack-daniel-s-collector-blog/my-first-whiskey-tasting-event,"<div class=""image-wrap""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-1.jpg"" alt=""My first whiskey tasting event""></div><p>I’ve been threatening for months that I was going to have a whiskey tasting event, this past Friday I finally did it. This post contains an overview of how I planned, how the event went and what lessons learned for future events.</p><h2>Planning</h2><p>The biggest hurdle to this event was just picking a date, for months I haven’t been able to get a date on the calendar, so in late January I threw one up (February 7th) and created a private Facebook event with info. I then sent the invite out to a small group of friends, some of which I had been talking about the event with for months. </p><p>In the Facebook I included a list of various bottles that I had acquired for the purpose of drinking over the past year, including selections of Jack Daniel’s, and non Jack Daniel’s bottles. I also requested that everyone bring an unopened bottle of their own, an if they felt like leaving it afterward they could. I ended up extending the invites out to 11 people, 8 of whom were able to make it. </p><p>As I neared the date I started prepping some things.</p><ol><li>I cleaned all my whiskey glasses, and wine glasses (not for use, but because they hadn’t been washed in…. years) </li><li>I purchased some new tasting glasses, 8 of them, shaped like Glencairn glasses, but not the brand.</li><li>I did a little reading on how best to host a whiskey tasting. (Google it) </li><li>I posted a link to an article about “infinity” bottles, or the idea of filling up a decanter with a variety of different whiskeys, either when a bottle is opened, or as a bottle nears it’s completion. I suggested everyone bring a decanter and we could see about filling them up.</li><li>I changed my mind about everyone bringing a decanter, and decided that I was going to buy some moonshine bottles and personalize them for the event (see the photos below, I think they turned out great).</li><li>Made a selection of ice for the event, for anyone who wanted ice in their glasses (not everyone did).</li></ol><p>At 5pm that evening I headed to the local grocery store, hoping to score some snacks, and hoping to score some whiskey for the night. In the local Bourbon Facebook group there were substantiated rumors that you could find some Weller’s Reserve and Eagle Rare at the Dierberg’s around town, so I headed to the Wildwood location with hopes of finding one or both. I was able to fill up the cart with snacks, and a bottle of the Dierberg’s Single Barrel selection of the Eagle Rare.</p><p>Final prep for the night of including getting the dining room table extended and bringing extra chairs up from the basement. I also picked up some crackers and pizza bites to warm up, in case anyone was hungry for something. The pizza bites didn’t last an hour.</p><p><br></p><h2>Event Experience</h2><p>Come the night of I was ready about an hour before the scheduled start time, so I sat down to read my copy of The Whiskey Advocate that mysteriously showed up in my mailbox a week ago. When the first guests showed up we took a seat in the kitchen and caught up a bit waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive.</p><p>As everyone showed up, all bringing a bottle of their choice, I gave a tour of the basement where I keep my “undrinkables”, my Jack Daniel’s collection. From there we took our seats at the dining room table, the location for the tasting, and I passed out the custom decanters. </p><p>Everyone got to choose a glass from the table, and then I tried to determine what we would start with. My original list on the invite had probably 12 different bottles of mine that I wanted to use, but I quickly realized that wasn’t going to be realistic, so we started with the guest provided bottles and mixed in 4 or 5 of mine throughout the night.</p><p>Everyone got a “dram”, a small pour, supposed to be 3/4 of an OZ, but unmeasured on my pours. We went in the following order:</p><ol><li>Eagle Rare (90 Proof) </li><li>Knob Creek Smoked Maple (90 proof)</li><li>Tamdhu Scotch (96 Proof)</li><li>New Riff Kentucky Straight Rye Bottled In Bond (100 proof)</li><li>Breckenridge Bourbon Whiskey (86 proof)</li><li>Sons of Erin Irish Whiskey (92 Proof)</li><li>Woodford Reserve (90.4 Proof)</li><li>Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye (86 Proof)</li><li>Blanton’s (93 Proof)</li><li>Jack Daniel’s Heritage Barrel 2019 (100 Proof)</li><li>Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold (80 proof)</li><li>George Dickel Bottled in Bond (100 proof)</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Outside of the tasting a few of us tried Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie, a scottish barley, which we mostly immediately regretted. </p><p>We had quite the variety of things to choose from on our first tasting. In the future we’ll have to decide if we want to try that many in one go again or not. Overall consensus was that the Blanton’s was the best. After that it was mixed, but I think the Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold was extra smooth and drinkable. Definitely glad we cracked that one open.</p><p>My buddy who brought the Whistle Pig Farmstock Rye brought me another bottle, we didn't open it, but I did get to keep it. It is a 100 Proof bottle of  The Legendary Hatfield & McCoy Family Brand Whiskey. I spent a few minutes looking online, and no proof of this bottle's existance can be found (you can find the 80 proof version, but I don't think 100 proof ever went to retail), how cool is that?</p><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><p>One, have fun. This was a great damn time. Invite some good friends, and invite some people you might not know that well. If you can get everyone to bring/leave a bottle, you can build up your collection! Be prepared, there was no way I had enough glasses for 9 people to try 12 different drinks. What we ended up doing was putting a bowl on each end of the table, and a pitcher of water. Rinsing the glasses out in between drams. This worked out pretty well, though I’m sure purists might cringe at the idea.</p><p>Doing an infinite bottle/decanter might not make sense at a tasting like this, maybe that comes with some sort of a bring a bottle/trade pours type of thing.</p><p>If I do this again in the future, no, not if, WHEN I do this again in the future, I will have to come up with another parting gift for everyone who attends.</p><p>I am already trying to figure out when the next one is, likely in April 2020. </p><p>Thinking I’ve got enough special edition Jack Daniel’s bottles we can crack open (in my drinkable selection) that we might just do a Night Dedicated To Jack Daniels. </p><div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-1.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-2.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-3.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-5.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-6.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-7.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-8.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-9.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-10.jpg""><img src=""/images/29/2-7-2020-11.jpg""></div>",2020-02-13T05:01:49.7066173Z,html

The first bottle that I learned about is one I hope to write about in the next week or two, as I don’t have it yet, but today I received my first bottle from the group.</p><p>This bottle was put together for the 2020 Daytona Beach Bike Week. The bottle is a single barrel selection chosen by the group, and contains a number of very cool things! The first, most noticeable item is the custom sleeve, with a photoshopped picture combining Easy Rider and the ocean. </p><p>It also contains a hang tag reading “Daytona Beach Bike Week 2020”.</p><p>It contains a sticker, a coaster, and a custom coin, along with an etched bottle.</p><p>The front of the coin reads the same as the logo on the sleeve:</p><blockquote><p>Daytona Beach, Florida</p><p>79th Bike Week</p><p>World’s Largest Motorcycle Event</p><p>2020</p></blockquote><p>The etched bottle reads the same as the coaster, and the back of the coin:</p><blockquote><p>Daytona Beach Bike Week</p><p>Ride Responsibly</p><p>Bottles &amp; Throttles Don’t Mix</p><p>2020</p></blockquote><p>I ended up ordering two of these bottles, and 3 extra sleeves. As I’ve gotten into the various Facebook groups I’ve seen these custom bottles and sleeves that have “scenes”, and when you have multiple boxes next to each other you can see the full scene, you can see this in the photos below as I have a shot of one of the sleeves fully spread out.</p><p>I look forward to partaking in future bottle sales that these groups do!</p><p><strong>Bottled: </strong>March 10, 2020<br><strong>Barrel Number:</strong> 20-01418<br><strong>Rick No.:</strong> L-17<br><strong>Release</strong>: March 2020<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 94<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml<br><strong>Price:</strong> $75/bottle</p><div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-1.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-2.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-3.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-5.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-6.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-7.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-8.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-9.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-10.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-11.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-12.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-13.jpg""><img src=""/images/30/DaytonaBikeWeek2020-14.jpg""></div>",2020-04-16T04:26:58.7945023Z,html
Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Eric Church (2019),JackDanielsEricChurch,"<div class=""image-wrap""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-5.jpg"" alt=""Jack Daniel's Eric Church Single Barrel 2019""></div><em>This post is for the 2019 version of the Eric Church bottle, stay tuned for information if we get a 2020 bottle!</em><p>As part of Eric Church’s Double Down US Tour Jack Daniels teamed up with the country artist for a limited edition single barrel bottle. The bottle appears to be a pretty standard single barrel bottle, ours was bottled on 12/19/2018, it came with a hang metal Eric Church Chief tag with JD Limited Edition on the back of the tag (see photos below).</p><p>The bottle came with/in a somewhat custom single barrel box. The front reads with the normal single barrel select branding, but has a black silhouette of the bottle with a rendering of the Eric Church / Chief tag.</p><p>The back of the box reads:</p><blockquote><p>Music and friendships were always important to Mr. Jack. That’s why we are proud to offer this limited edition Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel package celebrating our longstanding relationship with Eric Church. Not only is Eric a Friend of Jack, but he shared Jack Daniel’s spirit of community. In honor of that spirit we are making a donation in support of the “Chief Cares Fund,” a non-profit created by Eric and his wife, Katherine in 2013 to impact lives around the globe and in our own neighborhoods.</p></blockquote><p>You can still find the bottle online at some retailers.</p><p><strong>Release</strong>: 2019<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 94<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml<br><strong>Price:</strong> $65+</p><div class=""gallery"" data-columns=""3""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-1.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-2.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-3.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-4.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-5.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-6.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-7.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-8.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-9.jpg""><img src=""/images/24/EricChurch-10.jpg""></div>",2019-11-07T17:28:17.5160785Z,html
