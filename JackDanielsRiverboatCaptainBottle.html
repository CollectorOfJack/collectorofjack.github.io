							In September 2020, I received an email via my website asking if I
							might be interested in a bottle for sale.
						</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								I am in the process of liquidating estate items. One of the
								items is a Jack Daniels decanter “Riverboat Captain’s Bottle”. I
								have not found any way to sell on the internet and maybe you
								have some idea how to sell to a collector. This is an unsealed
								full bottle of 90 proof. It also has the box, and tag
								(unregistered). I would be glad to send pictures if I had your
								email address.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>
							This was actually the second time that someone had reached out to
							me in the past couple of weeks asking me about items that they
							were trying to sell from a family member. Both peaked my interest,
							but this particular email worked out because the seller was in Des
							Moines, about 340 miles from St. Louis. The other inquiry was from
							near Knoxville, close to 500 miles from St. Louis.
						</p>

						<p>
							I replied back to the inquiry and let them know I would be
							interested in the Riverboat Captain’s Bottle, after a few emails
							back and forth we settled on a price and the seller even offered
							to meet me near Kansas City. Not quite on the most direct route to
							Des Moines, but still close enough for a day’s round trip drive.
						</p>

						<p>
							I got up early this morning, changed the tires on the car, and
							headed off. Why did I need to change the tires? I decided to drive
							the FR-S, and had the “good” tires on it, with a few hundred mile
							drive, I didn’t feel like putting those miles on the tires with a
							few autocross events left in 2020, so I threw the stock wheels and
							cheap tires back on the car and took off west.
						</p>

						<h2 id="riverboat-captains-bottle-box">
							Riverboat Captain’s Bottle Box
						</h2>
						<p>
							The Riverboat Captain’s Bottle comes with a large box, with a
							riverboat picture on three sides, and text and a photo of the
							bottle on the rear. This particular box has a price tag on it,
							$29.99, imagine that. Back in 1987, this bottle could have been
							purchased for $30. Today it goes for north of $600 online.
						</p>

						<p>The rear of the box reads:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								He was a fine high-minded man, and greatly respected both ashore
								and on the river. He was very tall, well built and handsome; and
								in his old age - as I remember him - his hair was black as an
								Indian’s and his eye and hand were strong and steady and his
								nerve and judgement as firm and dear as anybody’s young or old,
								among the FRATERNITY of PILOTS. Mark Twain
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<h2 id="hang-tag">Hang Tag</h2>
						<p>
							The bottle came with a hang tag in black and gold, with red, and
							quite a bit of text. The front of the hang tag read:
						</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7. Riverboat Captain’s Bottle He was a
								fine high-minded man, and greatly respected both ashore and on
								the river. He was very tall, well built and handsome; and in his
								old age - as I remember him - his hair was black as an Indian’s
								and his eye and hand were strong and steady and his nerve and
								judgement as firm and dear as anybody’s young or old, among the
								FRATERNITY of PILOTS. Mark Twain
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<p>The inside of the hang tag read:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Getting Old No. 7 Aboard the Floating Palaces<br />
								Since he was a traveling whiskey salesman, Mr. Jack Daniel could
								be found in Nashville almost as often as in Lynchburg. And one
								of those natural attractions of the city in those days was the
								wharf at the end of Broad Street.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								To most folks, the visiting packets, showboats and
								tinsel-covered steamers, plus the sign of towering cotton bales
								and tobacco being carries by mules and roustabouts made the
								riverport one of the most exciting places on earth.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								But what intrigued Mr. Daniel about the riverfront signs was the
								abundance of “the carriage trade” awaiting passage to far-off
								places. If Old No. 7 won the approval of these folks, it would
								add considerable to his product’s growing reputation. That’s
								when Mr. Jack resolved to court the favor of the riverboat
								captain.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Amongst the waiting congregation, the most noticeable individual
								was the riverboat captain. A dramatic presence, dressed in a
								glimmer of white or the luster of polished black, the Captain
								did not merely participate in riverport gatherings, he presided
								over them.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								He’d tip his hate to the ladies and invite affluent planters and
								other members of the gentry on board for conversation. These
								gatherings inevitably led to a sampling of superb cigars and
								fine whiskey from Captain’s private stock.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								For in the end, the riverboat captain was a businessman who
								understood that a steamboat with a fine reputation for
								accommodations – staterooms, food and drink – would prosper.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Mr. Jack Daniel knew it too. That’s why he approached the
								riverboat captain of the Tennessee Belle with a most generous
								proposition.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								“Sir, I have travelled far and wide selling my fine Tennessee
								sippin ‘whiskey and never had less than praiseworthy reports
								from my customers. It’s as fine a potable as you could offer to
								your personal friends. All I ask is you take one sip. If you
								like it, I’ll see to it that your bottle is filled with Old. No.
								7 every time you visit Nashville.”
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Mr. Jack believed that a sip of Tennessee’s finest was all it
								would take to convince the most contrary soul. And once it
								became the personal choice of the captain, Uncle Jack knew his
								Old Number 7 would soon find its way to the taverns in the
								steamboat’s grand salon, where it could be consumed and
								appreciated by the “the carriage trade.”
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								So, for years to come, spectators at the Nashville wharf became
								accustomed to seeing several kegs of Old No. 7, along with the
								mules and roustabouts, the bales of cotton and tobacco, all
								anticipating the arrival of steamboats.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Even at the turn of the century, when steamboat travel was in
								its decline, a visiting riverboat captain might be overheard
								asking the whereabouts of Mr. Jack Daniel. Whether Mr. Jack was
								on hand or not, there was always an ample supply of his fine
								Tennessee sippin’ whiskey reserved for the steamboat master’s
								personal bottle. After all, a deal’s a deal.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								The bottle you hold, the RIVERBOARD CAPTAIN’S BOTTLE, was
								created to reflect the elegance of the days when steamboats
								ruled the great waters of our nation. The bell design tapers
								into a perfectly flat bottom to discourage tipping, a feature
								the Captains of the era fully appreciated in times of rough
								waters.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote>
							<p>
								You’ll be pleased to know that the whiskey inside your RIVERBOAT
								CAPTAIN’S BOTTLE is still made the old way – the same mellow
								potable Mr. Jack Daniel offered to the carriage trade of the
								steamboat age.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						<h2 id="the-bottle">The Bottle</h2>
						<p>
							The bottle itself is adorned with only a strip around the neck and
							the words Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 on the front.
						</p>

						<p>
							I am super stoked about this bottle myself. I can’t wait to build
							my shelving/storage so that I can properly display this bottle.
							The box I received has seen better days, it still holds it’s
							shape, and will hold the bottle. I don’t know how I will display
							the box in the future.
